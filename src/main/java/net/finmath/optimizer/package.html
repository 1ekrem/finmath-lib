	This package provides classes with numerical algorithm for optimization of
	an objective function and a factory to easy construction of the optimizers.
</p>

<p>
	Given that there are a variety of numerical libraries featuring optimization algorithms
	(e.g., Apache Commons Math), why do we provide a package inside finmath lib?
	This packages provides a unified interface for passing optimizers to other classes
	via an <code>OptimizationFactoryInterface</code> and an <code>OptimizerInterface</code>
	and an <code>OptimizerInterface.ObjectiveFunction</code>.
	This allows use of different optimization frameworks without bothering with the
	framework specific constructors and framework specific definitions of objective functions.
</p>

<p>
	A class implementing the <code>OptimizationFactoryInterface</code> allows the
	specification of parameters specific to the optimizer, but leave the specification
	of the initial values and the objective function still open. It provides a factory
	method which takes the objective function and initial values as parameters and
	constructs the specific optimizer by returning an object implementing
	<code>OptimizerInterface</code>.
</p>

<p>
	The package also contains an implementation of the Levenberg Marquardt optimizer,
	a multi-dimensional non-linear least-square.
	In addition we provide wrappers (via specific <code>OptimizationFactoryInterface</code>
	implementations) to some optimizers from Apache commons-math.
