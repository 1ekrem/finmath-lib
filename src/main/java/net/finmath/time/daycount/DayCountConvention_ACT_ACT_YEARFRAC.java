/**
 * Implementation of ACT/ACT as in Excel (2013).
 * 
 * Calculates the day count by calculating the actual number of days between startDate and endDate.
 * 
 * The method is only exact, if the two calendar dates are (approximately) on the same time. A fractional day is
 * rounded to the approximately nearest day (since daylight saving is not considered, the notion of nearest may be off by one hour).
 * 
 * The day count fraction is calculated using ACT_ACT_YEARFRAC convention, that is, it is calculates the daycount fraction
 * corresponding to the Excel (2013) function YEARFRAC(startDate, endDate, 1). The day count fraction is calculated by dividing
 * the actual number of days between start and end date by a denominator, where the denominator is determines as follows:
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>If the interval from start to end spans more than one year fraction, denominator is the average number of days per year</li>
 * 		<li>If the interval from start to end spans less or equal one year and if start and end fall in a leap year, denominator is 366.0</li>
 * 		<li>If the interval from start to end spans less or equal one year and if either falls in a leap year and if February 29th of that leap year lies in between start and end (or is equal to start or end), denominator is 366.0</li>
 * 		<li>If the interval from start to end spans less or equal one year and neither of the above applied denominator is 365.0</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This method is not identical to ACT_ACT_ISDA. For ACT_ACT_ISDA use {@link net.finmath.time.daycount.DayCountConvention_ACT_ACT_ISDA}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition the method has the defect, that it is not additive (if you consider small intervals). For example
 * YEARFRAC(30.12.2011, 04.01.2012, 1) is not equal to YEARFRAC(30.12.2011, 01.01.2012, 1) + YEARFRAC(01.01.2012, 04.01.2012, 1).
